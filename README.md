# useReducer Example

Here is a modest example of when useReducer() makes sense in a given React project.

This example was heavily inspired by a great YouTube video by Harry Wolff. You can
[find it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-nCM1857AQ&list=WL&index=1&t=959s).

Highly recommended.

For a quick look at the Javascript `array.reduce()` method, [see my codepen](https://codepen.io/garytalmes/pen/PoQPgZB?editors=1112).
